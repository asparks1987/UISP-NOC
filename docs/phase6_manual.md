# Phase 6 Item 6 - Manual Incident Creation & Simulate Outage

## Behavior
- Allow manual incident creation for testing or non-UISP events.
- Simulate outage action per device to validate alerts; auto-clear after TTL.

## Error/Diagnostics
- Responses include request_id; banners show simulation status and errors (e.g., device not allowed, already simulating).
