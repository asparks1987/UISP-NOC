## Core References

- [docs/inventory.md](inventory.md) — codebase inventory.
- [docs/CADDY.md](CADDY.md), [docs/DOCKERHUB.md](DOCKERHUB.md), [docs/GOTIFY.md](GOTIFY.md) — reverse proxy, container, and Gotify details.

## Phase Detail (legacy split, still valid)
- Phase 1–12 detail docs remain in `docs/phase*` for deep dives. Refer to `PROJECT_PLAN.md` first.
