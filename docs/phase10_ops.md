# Phase 10 Item 1 - Ops Observability & Hardening

## Observability
- Unified dashboards for poller lag, queue depth, notification failures, API errors.
- Alerts on health degradation; banners consume same signals.

## Security/Hardening
- Regular dependency scans; config checks; TLS enforcement.

## Error/Diagnostics
- Admin UI shows ops status with request_id and last error summaries.
