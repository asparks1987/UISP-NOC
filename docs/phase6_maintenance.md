# Phase 6 Item 2 - Maintenance Windows & Blackouts

## Behavior
- Maintenance windows mute alerts for scoped devices/sites/roles; inherit to children.
- Blackout periods (quiet hours) per user/team; critical override option.

## Error/Diagnostics
- Suppressed alerts record suppression reason; UI banner shows “suppressed by maintenance” with window details and request_id.
